Hereâ€™s a simple example of a login system in HTML and PHP that allows you to have a start page with a "Username" and "Password" field. 
You can set the username and password in the script itself and link it to a database (MySQL in this example) to check login credentials.

Step 1: Create the HTML login form (login.html)
- elite.html

Step 2: Create the PHP script to handle login (login.php)
- elite.php
// This script checks the credentials against a database //

Step 3: Create the Database and User Table
- DATABASE
 // Run this SQL code on your MySQL database to create a userbase database and a users table with username and password fields //

Steps for running the script:
// Set up MySQL: Ensure that MySQL server is installed, and create the userbase database with the users table.
//  Insert Users: You can manually insert more users into the users table using SQL queries, or create a registration page.
//   Run the PHP Script: Make sure you have a local web server running (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP, MAMP) or upload the script to a web server.
//     Configure the Database Connection: If your database is not on localhost, update the $servername, $db_username, $db_password, and $dbname variables in login.php accordingly.
